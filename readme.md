# Test Automation Project for APIs performance
# Cristian Camilo Reyes - Author

This project contains the test to measure the performance on an API using Selenium and RestAssured,
with test data provided by an Excel file. The goal is to perform API testing using dynamic data
read from Excel and measure the performance of the web application.

## Project structure

- `src/main/java`: Contains the main classes.
- `src/main/test/java/com/qa/tests`: The class with the tests cases
- `src/main/java/com/qa/util`: The class with apis URL and methods 
- `src/main/java/com/qa/testdata`: Contains the Excel file with the test data to consume the methods.
- `pom.xml`: Maven configuration file with project dependencies.

## Dependencies

The main dependencies of the project are:

- **Apache POI**: To read data from Excel files.
- **RestAssured**: To make calls to the API.
- **Selenium WebDriver**: For browser automation.
- **TestNG**: For the management and execution of tests.

## Configuration

1. **Install Maven**: Make sure you have Maven installed on your machine. You can download it from [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/).

2. **Clone Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine.
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/cristianreyes10491/PetStorePerformance

3. The API service must be active on the local machine, for this run the readme file that is hosted in the Swagger project and make sure that the endpoints respond from the UI

4. To compile and run all the project, from terminal execute the command 'mvn clean test'

5. If you want to run only a specific set of tests or a particular test class, you can use the following command:

   mvn -Dtest=UserAPITest test
